## Introduction

This solution combines my work lessons as found at Codility. I took time to resolve as many lessons as possible 
so as to boost my professionalism and skills in C#. The idea is going back to these lessons in other programming
languages so as to get familiar with their supporting API's and native libraries.

## Build and Run

CD to *.Tests project directory and run `dotnet test`
